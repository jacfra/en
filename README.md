# Meta Language Learning

English as a second language for native english speakers

## Goal

Broadly, this repository serves as structure for documenting a continually evolving language learning curriculm. Using the readers fluent understanding of english the reader should be able to gain or quantify some understanding of the knowledge required to obtain fluency in another language through looking at what's required in english.

## Why

I have a lot of suggestions to make language learning apps better so I decided to document my own curriculm at a high level.

### Requirements

This repository assume the reader has a fluent understanding of English.

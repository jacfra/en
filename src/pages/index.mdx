# Welcome ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

The information is organized by complexity (to the best of my knowledge) top down with the least complex articles near the top. Hopefully the information contained within should have a 2048 type of knowledge acquisition for you i.e. as you learn the more abundant and more simple concepts you can use those to break down and understand the more rare and complex topics.

### Why Meta Language Learning?

Learning new languages is hard.

I have found that my language learning efforts are expedited by catergorizing the different parts of what I am learning.

Additionally, I want to further my understanding of languages. My intention is to become a competant interpreter of multiple languages. This requires a deeper foundation of knowledge than a surface level exposure to conversational vocabulary.

### Target Audience

The target audience of this project is someone who speaks fluent english but does not have the specialized knowledge required to expedite language learning or to talk about the different portions of speech.

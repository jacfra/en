# Welcome ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

The information is organized by complexity (to the best of my knowledge) top down with the least complex articles near the top. Hopefully the information contained within should have a 2048 type of knowledge acquisition for you i.e. as you start and learn the more accessible concepts you can use those to break down the more rare and complex topics.

### Why Meta Language Learning?

Learning new languages is hard.

I have found that my language learning efforts are expedited by a divide and conquer approach to learning the fundamentals of what I am learning.

### Target Audience

The target audience of this project is someone who speaks fluent english but does not necessarily have the specialized knowledge and vocabulary talk about the different portions of english.

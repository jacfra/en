## Who

The target audience of this project is someone who is grew up speaking English.

## What

1. Documentation of the fundamental structures of the English language.
2. Spanish vocab to question, assert and clarify things about myself and my surroundings.

## Why

Learning new languages is difficult.

Having both, an understanding of the fundamental structures and the necessary vocabulary required to communicate knowledge about the fundamental structures of the language you learned as a child, will help you both learn about those structres in other languages and give you an idea of what you have yet to learn from a structural standpoint.

Once you feel you have a solid grasp of the fundamentals consider becoming TEFL (Teach English as a Foreign Language) certified.

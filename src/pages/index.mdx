# Welcome ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

## Who

The target audience of this project is someone who speaks fluent english but does not necessarily have the specialized knowledge and vocabulary talk about the different portions of english.

## What?

Broadly, Meta Language Learning serves as structure for documenting a continually evolving language learning curriculm. 

More specifically, you should be able to use this website to understand the structures and caterogies of english grammar. Once you understand those structures you should have a frame of reference for how far along you are in another language relative to your native language.

## Why?

Learning new languages is hard.

I have found that my language learning efforts are expedited by a divide and conquer approach to learning the fundamentals of what I am learning.

## How?

This website is an open source repoistory hosted on [github](https://github.com/jackdfraser/meta-language-learning) and built with react and nextjs.

Please feel free to contribute.

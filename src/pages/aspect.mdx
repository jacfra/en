# Aspect

Although, aspect may be more relevant in the future. All that's needed at first glance is:

Aspect is very similar to tense.

In European languages, rather than locating an event time, the way tense does, aspect describes "the internal temporal constituency of a situation", or in other words, aspect is a way "of conceiving the flow of the process itself".

## English Aspectual Distinctions:

Past: "I went, I used to go, I was going, I had gone".

Present "I sit, I am sitting, I have sat, I have been sitting, I am going to sit".

Future "I see, I will be seeing, I will have seen, I am going to see".

What distinguishes these aspects within each tense is not (necessarily) when the event occurs, but how the time in which it occurs is viewed: as complete, ongoing, consequential, planned, etc.
